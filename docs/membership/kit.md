# Diamonds Kit

Unlike many rowing clubs, buying kit is not obligatory. However, many members like to wear Diamonds kit when competing at in-person events. It's a great way to recognise people with whom you may have interacted online.

Memory Makers LLC has a range of clothing with the Diamonds logo.
