# Joining The Diamonds

## Affilate to Us

The easiest way to join the Diamonds is simply to login to [your Concept2 logbook](https://log.concept2.com/login) (or set one up if you haven't already), and in your profile set your affiliation to be "The Diamonds (Over Sixties Erging Group)". This is how most members join us.

This will cause all the metres that you row to be included in our Annual Metres World Record attempt, and make you eligible for a World Record certificate if we again succeed in beating our previous record.

It will also cause any rows that you rank, or any workouts of the day that you do to be attributed to the Diamonds.

## Join the Team

To go a step further, we encourage you to click on the Teams tab in your logbook, and select "The Diamonds (Over Sixties Erging Group)" as your team. Then check on the Edit Profile > Contact Preferences that you have checked the box next to "Receive Email from Team Captain", which will allow you to receive our weekly update email with news, tips and competition updates.

## Facebook Group

For the most active members, we have a smaller but very busy Facebook Group. If you'd like to join it, search for us on Facebook, but be warned, it comes with some responsibilities, and there is an application process. To keep the group coherant and fresh, we insist that members do the Cross Team Challenge each month and post updates on training and erging done at least once a month.
