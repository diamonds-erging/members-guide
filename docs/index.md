# Welcome to The Diamonds Members Guide

The Diamonds is a virtual erging group with over 3,000 members from all parts of the world. To join prospective members must be 59 or over (or will turn 59 during the current rowing season) and workout on a Concept2 erg. While most members row, many also use Concept2 SkiErgs or BikeErgs.

We participate in a competition against other clubs,  in regional, national and world championships and our own internal competitions, or just row for exercise, health and pleasure. Details of those competitions can be found [here](competitions). Links to the current standings in our internal competitions may be found below:
