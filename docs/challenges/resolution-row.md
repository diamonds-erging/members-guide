# Resolution Row

Following a suggestion from one of our members, wee invited everybody this year on Januuary 1st come together to undertake a continuous one hour row at a time to suit them.

The idea was for this to provide an opportunity to reflect on rowing (or other erging) achievements during 2025, and to set erging goals for 2026.

We thought that this would appeal to some members, but were astounded by how many joined in, and the breadth of feedback that they provided. This clearly resonated and has the makings of a new Diamonds tradition.
