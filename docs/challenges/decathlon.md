# Decathlon

One of our most popular competitions is the Decathlon. Anybody affilited to the Diamonds is automatically enrolled, and it's super easy to participate, just row any of the standard events from 100m up to a full marathon and hit the rank button in your Concept 2 logbook. We'll automatically pick it up in our daily update and include in the Decathlon.

Each qualifying row will be awarded points determined by an algorithm that takes account of your gender, age and weight class and compares your performance to the average of the best performances over the past 20+ seasons for similar rowers in that event.

Your overall score will be the sum of up to 10 event scores (which is why we call it the Decathlon), but there are 13 events to choose from, so whether you're a sprinter, a stayer, or just don't like the 2k, you choose where to focus your efforts. And if you're somebody who likes to get the full set each season, that's fine too, we'll calculate your overall score and position from your 10 best results.

If you're not affiliated to the Diamonds, and we know that there are some rowers whose affiliations are to their OTW clubs, that's not a problem, just let us know and we'll squeeze you in anyway.

The Decathlon is updated automatically each day and the latest standings can be seen at [https://bit.ly/diamond-decathlon](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zqf9P_7SnmoAq3zDPLrc35cK-uX4jHQ30CbdRKqsu9A/edit?usp=sharing).

The targets for each gender/weight combination and age can be found in the tables at [https://bit.ly/decathlon-targets-2026](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CosH0XSzxNzRgQ8qQDihJaUYlOpYhlL-FcmglcKHp5s/edit?usp=sharing). Or if you prefer to think in terms of splits, we have those too: [https://bit.ly/decathlon-target-splits-2026](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iYgk8w1KGT4MZywG_ie2LB_VfYouWw1zR8FZfzabcL0/edit?usp=sharing).

From the 2025/6 season, the Decathlon has been extended to the SkiErg and the BikeErg, so workouts ranked for thse modalities now have their own version of the Decathlon.
