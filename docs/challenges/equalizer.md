# The Equalizer and Consistency Challenge

Rowing the Cross Team Challenge or CTC each month is a core activity for the Diamonds and we encourage all members who are able to do it.

The CTC results are then fed into an algorithm that adjusts them to take account of each rower's gender, weight and age, making everybody's row comparable. The algorithm used was developed by Vianney Koelman, who explains in a [blog post](https://erg-all-rounders.blogspot.com/2022/11/).

We publish these adjusted results as a league table called The Equalizer. The [current](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18KZVt3KbxI-O5FDr4U7dXMVVj9Zc5otrfXKEVTKTYyo/edit?usp=sharing) and [previous](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TUfBuUSFmzndNOghMWHEv614IiNGL69QKJDRacUID5A/edit?usp=sharing) year's results are published as Google Sheets. The curren month is updated every 30 minutes.

We all kow that for any form of exercise, consistency is king. So alongside the Equalizer, we also publish the results of the [Consistency Challenge](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EjKoupp2_6kjWx0sfq41FXVjR0WfK_WTStc2Jsu_Pb0/edit?usp=sharing). This uses the monthly Equalizer results for the calendar year-to-date to calculate a score that favours those members doing the CTC consistently each month, and reports on the length of each member's CTC streak.

Although, like the Equalizer, the results are updated every 30 minutes, they are ordered by the column entitled "EoPM Score", which is short for "End of Previous Month Score as that is the most accurate indication of standings prior to the end of the month.

I hope that you enjoy the challenge that the CTC sets you each month, and find it helpful to see, on an adjusted basis, how your rows compare those of other members like, or unlike, you.
