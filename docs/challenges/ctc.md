# The Cross Team Challenge

The Cross Team Challenge, often referred to as the CTC, is a monthly highlight for many Diamonds. Each month a new challenge, designed to be capable of being completed "during a lunch hour" is chosen by one of the participating teams.

The Diamonds is, by far, the largest team, but don't under-estimate the others. There are some top rowers competing each month. However, it's not just for elite competitors. All Diamonds are encouraged to participate each month, often undertaking challenges that they might not previously have considered, and learning so much by doing so.

Of course, we're older than the other teams, so also we use the CTC results as a basis for one of our internal competitions, taking each member's performance and adjusting it to allow for age, gender and weight category to allow comparison with others on a level playing field.
