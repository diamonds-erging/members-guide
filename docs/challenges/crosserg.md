# CrossErg Competition

Feedback from members indicated that there was significant interest in a competition that would allow the “multi-ergers” to combine their performances on different ergs. So we accepted the challenge of designing a new competition that met this goal, while still remaining accessible to all members, even if the only erg to which they have access is that poorly-maintained, 20-year old Concept 2 rower at the local gym.

The result … The Diamonds CrossErg competition! Here’s how it works.

Each of the erg events is allocated to a discipline based on distance/time. We’ve called the disciplines sprints, strides and cruises. Once you have completed and ranked three events in any discipline, on any combination of ergs, we give you a rating for it that lets you see how you compare to other Diamonds. For this we use the same age, gender and (for RowErg only) weight category adjustments that we use for the [Decathlon](decathlon.md). Complete more than three events in the same discipline and we’ll calculate your rating from the best three.

But you don’t have to pursue ratings for all three disciplines. If you just don’t sprint (for example) that’s fine, you’ll still be able to compare your striding and cruising performances. Specialists are welcome.

However if you do achieve ratings for all three, we’ll also add you to the all-rounders list. But there’s a twist. The all-rounder ratings aren’t based just on your performances. They also take account of your consistency across the three disciplines. If you’re good at sprints and strides, but rubbish at cruising, then your all-rounder score will reflect that!

What do you need to do to participate in this new competition? Well, if your Concept2 account is affiliated to the Diamonds (and you’re therefore appearing in the Decathlon) then you’re already in, just do your workouts and rank them. If your affiliation is elsewhere, send me a message, and I’ll slip you in through the back door.

The current ratings can be seen at [https://bit.ly/crosserg](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TqKBWvDz-For31-T6jVe-ElmQVSgN0qsw7ewrhGt5yY/edit?usp=sharing) and are updated daily. You’ll also find details there as to which events are included in each discipline.
