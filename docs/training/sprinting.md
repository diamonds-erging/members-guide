# Sprinting

If you're used to long, steady rows, then some of the [Cross Team Challenges](../challenges/ctc.md) may come as shock. The shorter, faster intervals that they often include encourage a different technique. Specifically when contronted by them, it's worth experimenting with a higher stroke rate and a shorter drive.

A shorter drive means less compression at the catch or what is often referred to as a 3/4 length drive. Instead of maximising drive length, your objective becomes to push your stroke rate as high as possible and may go as high as the 50s, 60s and even 70s for very short sprints. 

But this can create other problems. If you’ve ever pushed really hard on your erg, felt your backside lift off the seat and then land on the rail, you’ll know that it’s not the most comfortable experience, and more importantly, tanks your performance. For this reason many of us use a strap when sprinting. In this document I’ll explain how that works.

But firstly, is it cheating? Absolutely not. Concept 2 have confirmed that it’s perfectly OK, including in competition. Think of it as a piece of safety equipment.

So what type of strap should you use? Well, any strap that fits under the seat (see the next section for more about this) is fine. Personally I opt for a 1” (2.5cm) wide luggage strap.

I like this width because it’s narrow enough to fit nicely under the seat, but wide enough to not cut into my flesh when in use, and the quick release fastener allows me to get off the seat quickly when the row is over. They’re also very adjustable, durable and sweat resistant.

How do you fit it? Let’s take a look under your erg’s seat. See that triangular space between the seat and the metal bracket? There’s one on the other side too and they’re perfect for passing the strap through and then up and over the top of your thighs.

Don’t make it too tight. You’re not trying to strap yourself to the seat, restricting your range of movement. Rather you’re aiming to ensure that the seat moves with you and is there to support you when you come down again, and that only needs minimal pressure.
