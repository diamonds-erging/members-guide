# Stroke Rates

There are training rates and there are racing rates. For most of your training it's good to use lower rates like 18 to 20 as they help build power, technique and control. When you want to go as fast as you can (which I would suggest should be no more than once or twice a week depending on how many sessions you do...) then you can go as high as feels right for getting the best pace.(As long as it's not too high as that just wastes energy go up and down the rail too often).
