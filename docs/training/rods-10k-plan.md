# Rods 10k Training plan

Suitable for new starters, first time 10k’s and rowers getting back into it.

This is not an advanced level plan so heart rate caps are kept below 92.5% of Maximum for interval sessions and 70% for the steady rows. Someone looking for a faster 10k than previous efforts would not have a cap on some sessions but it would not be sustainable in the long term.
This plan assumes a return to progressive training after recovering from the 10k Time Trial.
 
A 5-week plan allowing for tapering before the Time Trial so effectively 4 weeks training.

Take one day of rest and more if you feel you need them.
Any Interval session up to 92.5% can be replaced by a CTC effort.
Pacing advice by direct discussion before starting.
Stroke rates for the Interval sessions to be discussed as the plan progresses.
