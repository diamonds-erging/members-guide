# Rowing on Slides

Most indoor rowers, row on what is often called a static erg. However, a growing minority prefer to row "on slides".

Slides are an optional accessory that allow the rowing machine to move back and forth on tracks, simulating the motion of a real boat and creating a more realistic, dynamic rowing experience compared to a stationery erg.

Instead of the user moving up and down the rail, they stay in a near stationary position and the erg itself moves underneath them. This requires better rowing technique but improves rhythm, timing and body connection. for many older rowers it has the additional benefit of reducing the stress on the lower back and knees.
