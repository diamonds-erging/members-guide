# Rowing Terminology

## Drag Factor

The damper lever on the side of yor rower is not a difficulty setting … the lever controls the amount of air entering the fan cage and therefore how much it slows the Flywheel down between each stroke

If the damper lever is on 5 (for example) on one machine it could have a very different ‘’feel’’ to 5 on another as they all vary depending on how much dust is accumulated in the fan cage so the way to compare machines is ...the ''Drag Factor'' which is a measure of the speed at which the flywheel slows down. 

To set it.... On the monitor press ''More Options''.... then press ...''Display Drag Factor'' a box will come up with a number in it when you row a few strokes…that’s the drag factor...then row some more strokes raising or lowering the lever to adjust it. 

Raising the lever raises the number...lowering the lever lowers it. I'd suggest starting at 110 then experiment from there to find what suits you best, here's some useful info;

## PB and PR

PB (personal best) and PR (personal record) are used to indicate your best performance typically for a standard Concept2 event. They aren't necessarily lifetime bests - we recognise that copeting with our much younger selves may be futile, but in general indicate your best for your current Concept2 age category (60-64, 65-69, etc).

## Split

The term split can cause confusion as it is used in two different ways.

Firstly we use it to describe speed per 500 metres on the RowErg or SkiErg so, for example, if you are rowing at a split of 2:00, it will take 2 minutes to travel 500m. On a BikeErg, the split is calculated as time taken per 1000m.

But you also hear the term used in statements such as "I improved my 2k PB by 2 splits". Suppose that your old PB was achieved at a split (previous definition) of 2:10, improving by 2 splits would mean compelting the 2k at a faster 2:08. As 2k = 4 x 500m, this would mean that you were 8 seconds faster overall.

You may also see pacing advice in the form "2k + 3". This happens often when discussing how to tackle a series of intervals and is an implicit reference to the 2nd definition above. If your new 2k PB is 2:08 then you 2k + 3 pace would be 2:11.

## Season

Most sports have a season, usually designed around the times of year when participation is likely to be highest and therefore geographically-specific. Indoor Rowing can be done all year round, so the season is a full 12 months long, starting on May 1st and running to the end of the following April.
