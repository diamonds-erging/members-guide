# Facebook Rules

We're a competitive team of of C2 Indoor Rowers on an Interactive page, in or over (a long way over in many cases!) our 60th year in the current season...and it's funny how the older we get...the more ''Competitive'' we become! We ask all members to offer positive and supportive comments to teammates…as at our age they are a big help😂

We enter various competitions as a team so ask members not to promote teams or facebook groups other than our own on our page. Various teams have Diamonds in their name but we are ''The Diamonds (Over Sixties Erging Group)'' on both the FB Group and the C2 site where we participate in the various challenges ... and very often win them! 😀

For those on the Facebook part of the team the Monthly Cross Team Challenge (CTC for short) is our main competition and it’s part of team membership to give it a go every month as we need all members to help the team by contributing a score. (Doing it for a different team will mean you have left us as we are very much a ‘’team’’ not an ‘’open group’’). Missing more than 2 consecutive months can affect your membership but we’ll offer as much help as we can to keep you going and injuries, illness and ‘life’ situations are of course understood and allowed for.

To keep the group vibrant up to date and as described ''interactive'' we ask all members to post training and race reports (with some words not just stats, screenshots (showing the memory screen in pace pleeeeze ... not Watts or Calories ... and no Bold type used in headings pleeeeeze ... they are for admin announcements only) with age/weight to give context which helps with making comments to you and only mention Drag Factor used not the Damper setting as DF can vary from M/C to M/C on the same lever number due to dust etc.) whenever they can (and a minimum of once a month to let us know you're OK and still joining in with us) as we do need all members to contribute otherwise the group would have no purpose ... or be as much fun and if no-one posted or commented we wouldn't have a group at all so do stress the need for activity where possible as that way we can all help each other out ... which we certainly need!😉So please offer supportive comments to fellow members as well as posting your own efforts. It's about ''give'' as well as ''take'' 😀

Team members can of course be in as many facebook Indoor Rowing groups as they like but please try to make sure you are supporting our page as your main place of posting. If you are posting and commenting on other groups but not supporting ours and helping your teammates then inevitably it could bring your membership into question.

We do try to be as flexible as possible but we can’t offer room to those who only want to read posts and comments but not interact with the team by making them so we hope to see you on the page telling us about the rowing you've done and we in turn will be able to offer some support and encouragement ... it's ''Interactive'' ... so it's a 2 way process. 😃
We do ask that they be mostly Indoor rowing posts please. On Water’, bike erg or ski erg for example or anything else you think may be of interest are also ok but we are an Indoor Rowing team so please not those exclusively.

Please show age/weight (as well as some words not just stats) on all posts with screenshots to give context which helps with making comments to you.

No Bold type used in headings pleeeeeze ... they are for admin announcements only. 😀

Please refer to ‘’Drag Factor’’ rather than lever settings on your posts as the feel can vary on those numbers but not the DF.
We do try to give plenty of leeway on things you think will be of interest. Musical tastes, Holidays, Socialising and Fishing seem to be popular topics! 😂

Video calls ... are available and may be the best way to help explain things to you if needed.

Do please let me know if I can help with anything ... Happy Diamonds rowing!
